# CS50 AI: Problem Sets Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (CS50 AI)** by Harvard University.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  
These solutions are shared **only for learning purposes**. They must **not** be copied or submitted as original work in the course. Submitting someone else‚Äôs work violates the academic honesty policy.  

My work here is the result of:  
- Research and reviewing documentation / examples  
- Debugging and experimentation with Python and AI libraries  
- Guidance from ChatGPT (for explanations and debugging help)  
- My own creativity and problem-solving process  

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey and approaches to AI problem sets, not to provide ‚Äúready-to-submit‚Äù answers.

## Notes
- If you are currently enrolled in CS50 AI, make sure to solve the problems yourself first.  
- Use this repo for **inspiration and reference**, not as a shortcut.
