# CS50 Web: Problem Sets Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from **CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (CS50 Web)** by Harvard University.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  
These solutions are meant for **educational reference only**. They should **not** be copied or directly submitted in the course, as that violates the academic honesty rules.  

My code is built through:  
- Studying official documentation and online resources  
- Experimentation with Python, Django, JavaScript, and SQL  
- Guidance from ChatGPT (for hints, debugging support, and explanations)  
- My own ideas, implementation choices, and style  

The main aim of this repository is to showcase my progress and learning process in web programming, not to offer a collection of ‚Äúdrop-in‚Äù solutions.

## Notes
- If you‚Äôre taking CS50 Web, try building your own projects first.  
- This repo is a reference for learning approaches and debugging tips.
