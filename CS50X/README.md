# CS50x: Problem Sets Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from **CS50x ‚Äì Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  
These solutions are published **only for reference and inspiration**. They should **not** be copied or submitted as your own work. Doing so would violate the academic honesty policy of the course.  

My code is the result of:  
- Research and reviewing examples available online  
- Trial and error, debugging, and personal problem-solving  
- Guidance from ChatGPT (for hints, debugging help, and explanations)  
- My own creativity and implementation choices  

The main goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and share my journey, not to provide ready-made answers for others to submit.

## Notes
- If you are taking CS50x, I highly encourage you to try solving each problem set **on your own first**.  
- Use this repository as a resource for learning approaches, not as a shortcut.
